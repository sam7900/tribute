       Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954)
       was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
       philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
     </p>
     <p id="tribute-info">
       Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science,
        providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
         which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.
       </p>
     <p id="tribute-info">
        He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
